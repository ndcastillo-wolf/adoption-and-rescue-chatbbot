# adoption-and-rescue-chatbbot

This project is aimed to perform chatbot solutions that will serve pet shelters and rescuers. 

The following commits will be coded based on feedback from shelter owners and rescuers based in Mexico city, since they are the front line individuals that shall shape this project and contribute to create a useful solution through their feedback. 

Every single line of this code will be created with love, and a strong commitment to create technology that serves lovely creatures that deserve love, respect and a lovely family.
